# Psychic-Game

Overview

The project brief was to create a game where the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

Project Details
- The app records the wins, losses, guesses left, guesses so far. 
- When the player wins, the wins counter increases and the game starts again without the page refreshing.
- When the player loses, the loss counter increases and the game starts again without the page refreshing.
